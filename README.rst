WeChat (Weixin) Chat Log Library
================================

`WeChat (Weixin, 微信) <http://www.wechatapp.com>`_ is a popular IM app
available on iOS, Android and other mobile platforms. Despite its popularity,
users have learned that there is no *simple* way to view and export chat log
from the app itself. Python-WeChat is aimed to create a library to make working
with WeChat's chat log easy, so other tools can be developed, and ultimately,
WeChat users will have convenient accesses to their *own* chat log.
